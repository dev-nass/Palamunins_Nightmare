# Palamunins Nightmare

Is a Job Sport website for those who needs them. The primary aim of this website is to help the makers to review their knowledge of Vanilla PHP

# PHP Template Improvements:

- Create a `Request` and `Validator` class for housing the logic lump together on the controller.
- Fixed the `Validator` class required function and added the `$this->field_name` on the `isset()` if statement.
